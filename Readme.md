## Instructions to Run Projects

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repo-url>`.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor of choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Install all necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal window within your code editor or from the command line if using a different code editor (e.g., Atom).
4. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm start` to launch the project in your browser window and view it locally on your machine at http://localhost:3000/.
